## Playback Description

The objective of the session is to discuss and demonstrate the use of NLP-based ontologies supported by a graph database to extract rich knowledge from structured and unstructured data. Ontologies identify concepts, beyond simple keyword searching, and the relationships and hierarchies that connect those. This mimics the process used by the human brain to connect these concepts, making the results transparent and highly explainable to an average person without deep knowledge of statistics, machine learning, or other data science skills. During this session, a demo will be provided of a real-world use of an ontology to identify IBMers likely to possess specific skills.
